<h1>The Best Movies According to Ilyas</h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>I love the movie for its college backdrop and how the movie rovolves around the main character who in disguise turns out to be the topper of the college</p>
<h3>Ye Jawaani hai Deewani</h3>
<p>The movie is a love story, wherein the lead actor is behind his goals and the actress is a girl next door who falls for him</p>
<h3>Taare Zameen par</h3>
<p>A child who has issues reading and writing find a teacher who recognizes his true talent and makes him confident to present in to the world for others to know his true potential</p>
